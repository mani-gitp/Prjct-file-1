      "I Believe conducting the course in Hindi Language was the best part. All the concepts were explained in a very simple easy to understand way. The prompt sheets prepared are also very useful for future use. Looking forward for more such creative courses by Dhruv.",

      "The lessons were given and organised in a fantastic way. Dhruv has the capacity to maintain the audience's attention. If you would have included how ChatGPT could be utilized for more coding-related subjects, it would be more beneficial to me personally. But I am aware that this course needs to be more inclusive to appeal to all students.",
